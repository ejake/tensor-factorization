    " * Sentiment analysis (e.g. comments on products)\n",
    " * Document categorization (e.g. spam filtering, language identification, news categorization)\n",

    "Standard machine learning approaches can receive directly a set of fixed-length features with numerical or categorical data. However, to deal with sequences such as words or sound, a preprocessing step is usually required (Images adapted from [indico's tutorial](https://indico.io/blog/general-sequence-learning-using-recurrent-neural-nets/)).\n",

    "A language model computes the probability of a sequence of words. The main idea is to learn a model that computes higher probabilities to more likely sequences of words, e.g.:\n",
    "$$P(the\\ cat\\ is\\ small) \\geq  P(small\\ the\\ is\\ cat)$$\n",
    "$$P(walking\\ home\\ after\\ work) \\geq  P(walking\\ house\\ after\\ work)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a quite popular option to learn a language model and the distributed representation of words. Since they are good at modelling sequences. Theoretically they can condition the model on all previous word on the corpus. The following is the classical architecture of a RNN: <img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uGNd1LZ.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are also attractive because they are capable of handling an input of arbitrary size. Concretely they have three layers: an input, a hidden and an output layer. Interestingly RNNs combine the input vector with the state vector(hidden layer) using a learned function, then they produce a new state vector and therefore an output vector. Essentially RNNs receive a sequence of vectors as input and produce an output sequence of vectors. **An output produced by a RNN is influenced not only by its current input, but by all the past inputs the RNN has been fed**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A more expressive recurrent unit: Gated Recurrent\n",
    "To overcome issues related to the training process (Vanishing and exploding gradient), hidden units with gates has been proposed. In particular, we will use the Gated Recurrent Unit ([Cho et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1259)):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"gru.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, $r$ and $z$ works as \"Gates\" that controls the information flow. $r$ (reset gate) allows or blocks the usage from previous states ($h_(t-1)$) in the current state ($h_t$). $z$ (update gate) controls whether $h_t$ is updated.\n",
